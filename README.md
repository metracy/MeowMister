# MeowMister
 
MeowMister is a program to control a water turret to focus on a pet and then control a solenoid with high pressure water to blast your pet with water. It utilizes pyfirmata2, the modified FirmataExpress sketch and opencv to control a servo to rotate the turret.  I am using a modified FirmataExpress module that includes support for the Seeed XAIO m0 board.

Added shell script to start the processes and launch servo_control.py and target_acquisition.py
