# MeowMister
 
MeowMister is a program to control a water turret to focus on a pet and then control a solenoid with high pressure water to blast your pet with water. It utilizes pyfirmata2, the FirmataExpress sketch and opencv to control a servo to rotate the turret.  I am using a modified FirmataExpress module that includes support for the XAIO m0 board.
